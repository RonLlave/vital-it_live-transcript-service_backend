# Agent Session - July 24, 2025

## Session Overview
This session focused on implementing fixes for speaker identification, adding new API endpoints for the Meeting Bot team, and improving the overall API consistency of the Live Transcript Service.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Speaker Identification Issues
- **Problem**: Transcripts were showing "Unknown" and "Speaker 1" labels despite providing participant names
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced Gemini prompt to use more direct speaker naming approach
  - Added aggressive post-processing to replace generic labels with participant names
  - For single participant meetings, all segments now use the participant's name
  - Implemented `normalizeSpeakerNames` method with fuzzy matching for multiple participants

### 2. Disabled Automatic Transcription
- **Reason**: Frontend team requested manual control over transcription timing
- **Changes**:
  - Commented out BotPoolMonitor and AudioFetchService initialization
  - Disabled automatic bot pool subscription in TranscriptStreamService
  - Updated health checks to show services as "disabled"
  - Service now operates in frontend-initiated mode only
  - All code preserved for potential future re-enabling

### 3. API Consistency Improvements
- **Enhancement**: Made `/api/transcribe/summary` consistent with other endpoints
- **Previous**: Required pre-transcribed segments
- **Now**: Accepts same inputs as raw endpoint (audio URL and participants)
- **Benefit**: All three transcribe endpoints now have identical request formats

### 4. Speaker Label Strategy Update
- **Change**: `/api/transcribe/raw` now uses generic speaker labels
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `useGenericSpeakers` parameter to transcription service
  - Raw endpoint returns "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc.
  - Gemini intelligently detects number of speakers
  - Other endpoints continue using participant names

### 5. New Database Integration Endpoints

#### `/api/transcribe/raw_save`
- **Purpose**: For Meeting Bot team to save transcripts to Supabase
- **Features**:
  - Accepts record ID and public audio URL
  - Transcribes with generic speaker labels
  - Saves to `raw_transcript` column
  - Updates `speakers_identified_count`
  - Sets status to 'completed' or 'failed'
  - Handles errors gracefully

#### `/api/config_speakers`
- **Purpose**: Replace generic speaker labels with participant names
- **Features**:
  - Accepts record ID and ordered participant array
  - Maps participants[0] → "Speaker 1", participants[1] → "Speaker 2", etc.
  - Updates all segments and full text
  - Preserves original labels in `originalSpeaker` field
  - Sets `is_speaker_configured` to true

## Technical Details

### Code Structure Changes
```
src/
├── api/
│   └── routes/
│       ├── transcribe.js (enhanced with raw_save endpoint)
│       └── config-speakers.js (new file)
└── services/
    └── GeminiTranscriptionService.js (updated prompts and methods)
```

### Key Code Additions

1. **Generic Speaker Prompt** (GeminiTranscriptionService.js):
```javascript
if (useGenericSpeakers) {
  prompt = `This is an audio file. Transcribe it and intelligently identify different speakers.
  ...
  Use consistent labels: "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", "Speaker 3", etc.`;
}
```

2. **Speaker Mapping** (config-speakers.js):
```javascript
const speakerMapping = {};
participants.forEach((name, index) => {
  speakerMapping[`Speaker ${index + 1}`] = name;
});
```

3. **Database Updates**:
- Added `speakers_identified_count` tracking
- Added `is_speaker_configured` flag management

### API Documentation Created
- `docs/meeting-bot-raw-save-api.md` - Comprehensive API guide
- `docs/to_meeting-bot-team_raw-save-prompt.md` - Quick start guide
- `docs/config-speakers-api.md` - Speaker configuration API
- `docs/to_frontend-team_config-speakers.md` - Frontend integration guide

## Environment Configuration
No new environment variables added. Service continues to use:
- `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` - For transcription
- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` - For database operations
- `TRANSCRIPTION_START_DELAY` - 30-second delay before transcription

## Testing Notes
- All endpoints tested with provided example data
- Speaker identification improvements need real-world validation
- Database integration requires proper Supabase configuration

## Deployment Requirements
1. Service needs restart on Coolify to apply all changes
2. Ensure Supabase credentials are properly configured
3. Frontend teams should update their integration to use new endpoints

## Known Issues Addressed
1. **Speaker Identification**: Fixed generic labels appearing despite participant info
2. **API Consistency**: Resolved inconsistent request formats across endpoints
3. **Database Integration**: Added missing functionality for Meeting Bot team

## Future Considerations
1. Consider adding webhook support for transcription completion
2. Implement batch processing for multiple audio files
3. Add speaker confidence scores to help with mapping accuracy
4. Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed transcripts

## Session Summary
This session significantly improved the Live Transcript Service by fixing critical speaker identification issues, adding database integration capabilities, and making the API more consistent and user-friendly. The service is now better equipped to handle both frontend-initiated transcriptions and backend database operations for the Meeting Bot team.
